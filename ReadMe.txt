Notes:
PlayerManager.cs is in place of PlayerControl. (Differently named, but handles player health and inventory)

Some additional features not explicitly mentioned on the assignment description:
- Animated custom player model
- Static damaging obstacles (spikes)
- Spawn points
- Coin collectables
- Sound effects
- Dynamic UI rendering and player spawning for cleaner level transitions
- Use of PropertyAttributes for code documentation (Mouseover on a script attribute in the inspector will show a tooltip)
